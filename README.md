# This is a repository for Startup Engineering 2 course for decision maker

## 1. Prerequisites
The projects uses Python v3, appropriate version should be installed. Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`, they are to be installed via `pip` (`pip install -r requirements.txt`). <br>
We think that using some Javascript-build tool is an overkill, so all Javascript dependencies are included in repository.

## 2. Running the project
You can run the project from command line, given you have Python interpreter configured: `python manage.py runserver`.<br>
It's a really good idea to have it as a run configuration in IDE (I'd use PyCharm).
